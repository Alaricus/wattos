# Watto's Spaceship Emporium

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Starting the app
To run the app locally, first you need to install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`.

When finished run a development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Technical decisions

The app uses React hooks because hooks are awesome and classes are not.

The app doesn't use Redux, because it offers no benefit to such a tiny project.

## Design decisions

The most difficult design decision was to continue working after seeing your site and knowing full well that I couldn't produce something like that even in a year.

I thought that adding several languages (well, fonts really) for Aurebesh, Mandalorian, and that one language from Dark Forces, in addition to English, would make the site enticing to more customers.

The site is also mobile-friendly, and should be accessible.

All of the assets (images, favicon, 3D models, and fonts) are stolen from the Internet because I don't know how to make them myself.
