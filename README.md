# Watto's Spaceship Emporium

Live version is at [https://alaricus.github.io/wattos](https://alaricus.github.io/wattos)

## Starting the app
To run the app locally, first you need to install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`.

When finished, run a development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

Alternatively you can change the `"homepage"` property in ***package.json*** to read `"/"` and then create a build by running `npm run build` or `yarn run build`. Once ready, start a local server by running `node server.js` from within the project directory. The app will be available at [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/). (This requires Express.)
